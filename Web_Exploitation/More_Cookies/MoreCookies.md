It's a base64 but when I decode it, it's still in gibberish, So it's encrypted. 

Checking the hint 


Hint 1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption 

 

Homomorphic encryption is a form of encryption with an additional evaluation capability for computing over encrypted data without access to the secret key. The result of such a computation remains encrypted. Homomorphic encryption can be viewed as an extension of public-key cryptography. 

 

The capitalization of the letters C, B, and C in the challenge description indicates that cipher block chaining (CBC) is being utilized. CBC is vulnerable to a bit flip. In essence, a single bit defines whether or not the user is an administrator. Maybe there's a parameter like admin=0 that we can set admin=1 by changing the right bit. We can test every place till we receive the flag because the position of this bit is unknown.

That is the flag
